        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Press Press is an interdisciplinary publishing initiative established in 2014. Press Press's publishing practice is organized around two key goals; first, to shift and deepen the understanding of voices, identities, and narratives that have been suppressed or misrepresented by the mainstream, so far focusing on immigration and race in the United States; and second, to build networks of relationships through publishing practices centered on self-representation and gathering. Through an understanding of publishing as the act of gathering a public, Press Press's streams of work include public cultural programming, an open-access publishing studio that's based on an Exchange Economy, youth publishing workshops in an immigrant & refugee only space, and the ongoing production of print and digital publications. Press Press operates out of a storefront studio and library in Baltimore, MD.

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Press Press's work pushes for a culture that values the lives, minds, and experiences of communities whose voices have historically been suppressed or misrepresented by the mainstream, calling on our society at large to rethink the ways we interact with others in the world. Through this work, we are building a supportive community that enables us to thrive.

          <h2>Team & Collective Structure</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Press Press</i> is a fluid and reflexive network of co-authors and co-organizers. Depending on the project at hand, there may be anywhere from 1-45 people involved at a time and at various levels of capacity; from authoring publication chapters and library sections, speaking at an event, organizing a party, and more. Since we understand <i>Press Press</i> as a collectively-built and reflexive structure, we see all individuals and groups who steps into the project as crucial members of our team. However, there are some more consistent organizers we want to note by name:
          </p> 

          <ul>
            <li>Kimi Hanauer, Founding Artist & Editor</li>
            <li>Bomin Jeon, Organizing Member</li>
            <li>Valentina Cabezas, Organizing Member</li>
            <li>Rahul S. Shinde, Website & Digital Engineer</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>History</h2>
           
          <p>
            In 2014, <i>Press Press</i> started its partnership with <a href="http://www.refugeeyouthproject.org/" target="_blank">Refugee Youth Project</a> by holding creative writing workshops with a group of teens in Catonsville, Maryland. When starting to publish the work of our collaborators, we realized we needed to give our initiative a name, and so <i>Press Press</i> was born. Since then, <i>Press Press</i> has broadened its activities beyond the after-school program. However, our after-school workshops have continued to be a large thread of our practice as we carry the principles the program was initiated with throughout all of our work: embracing collaboration, self-representation, and difference.

          <h2>The Press Press Library </h2>
           
          <p>
            <i>The Press Press Library</i> is a collection of resources and publications that were recommended and thematically organized by more than 35 individuals, collectives, and organizations throughout 2016-2017, each of which selected a range of resources they deemed most essential to their practices. While the collection was mostly created through a local contingency, it also works in conversation with a national network of artist-organized initiatives. Located in Press Press’s Baltimore store-front, the library was created as a way of collectively molding the culture of the space, holding Press Press’s work accountable to its context, and building on our approach to publishing. Press Press also houses The Contemporary's collection of artist books and magazines.

          <h2>Refugee Youth Scholars Program</h2>

          <p>
            Through a partnership with Baltimore City Community College Refugee Youth Project since 2014, Press Press hosts publishing workshops with teen refugees in an immigrant and refugee only space. The space is designed to counter the standard model of ESL (English Second Language) learning. The standard model operates in a way that erases or ignores the identities of the learners in an effort to fit them into the hegemonic linguistic mode of the United States. The collaborative space we’ve created, conversely, places the identities and narratives of the participants as central in the experience of learning and using English; or learning how ‘to be’ in English as one’s second language without erasing one’s native voice. For example, we regularly print poetry in the exact form it was written, without ‘correcting’ for grammar and spelling. The aim is to affirm the ways participants express themselves in this linguistic medium. In Spring of 2018, we shifted the program to hire youth as professional writers and artists creating content to be published by Press Press.

          <h2>Exchange Economy</h2>
           
          <p>
            With Press Press’s Exchange Economy (EE), anyone can learn how to self-publishing their work in our studio, in exchange for any contribution to the broader project. Through the use of time-banking, EE cultivates new programs, resources, workshops, and relationships in our storefront space, while building a community of new and experienced independent publishers. Participants only pay for the use of materials at cost and can choose to participate in one-on-one learning with a member of our team during our weekly open hours. Our community publication studio includes a Risograph, screen-printing, and binding equipment.

          <h2>Publications</h2>
           
          <p>
            Press Press publishes a range of print and digital publications that give form to our programmatic and ethereal practice. Our collaborative process often takes upwards of a year to complete one publication and emphasizes social gathering as a primary mode of the work. Our publications vary widely in form, although we are keen to manifestos, conversations, and artist projects. By annually participating in the art book fair circuit, including Printed Matter’s New York Art Book Fair and LA Art Book Fair, we circulate our publications across the United States. Press Press publications can be found in the collections of The Whitney Museum of Art, The University of Florida, ACRE Projects, Wendy’s Subway, Mount Analogue, Printed Matter, and the John M. Flaxman Library at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

          <h2>Manifesto for Tender Collaborative Work</h2>
           
          <p>
            Produced in collaboration with Jenna Porter, Iris Lee, and Shan Wallace, our team developed a manifesto for tender collaborative practice that we hold closely throughout every facet of our work. Rather than a cemented series of rules, we understand this set of guidelines as reflexive, transitory items that are open for interpretation, in relationship to the project at hand. With that said, our collaborative approach tends to follow the principles outlined below;
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Embrace and support one another fully. You are at your best when you feel accepted.</li>
            <li>Don’t compartmentalize. Be yourself and bring that into the work.</li>
            <li>Mold the structure of your work around the people who are part of it.</li>
            <li>Be tender to your collaborators identities, experiences, and daily challenges.</li>
            <li>Know what is going on in your collaborators lives. Don’t assume your project is their priority at all times.</li>
            <li>Universal love. Pick up the extra slack when needed.</li>
            <li>The product is never more important than the process or the relationship.</li>
            <li>Embrace difference! We are different, let’s address our differences directly.</li>
            <li>Paid time. Creative freedom. Femme-centric space.</li>
            <li>Trust the process and trust the people. Make space for each other’s quirks.</li>
            <li>Know and embrace your own subjectivity. There is no such thing as being objective.</li>
            <li>No Hierarchy. No one should have more control than someone else.</li>
            <li>Let go of control and try stepping into a supportive role.</li>
            <li>Let yourself be vulnerable.</li>
          </ol>
